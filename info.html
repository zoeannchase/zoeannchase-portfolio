    <p>Taking care of your new tattoo is crucial for proper healing and long-lasting results. Here's how to care for your ink:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🧼 Wash your hands before touching your tattoo.</li>
      <li>🫧 Gently clean your tattoo with lukewarm water and mild, fragrance-free soap.</li>
      <li>🧻 Pat dry with a clean paper towel — don't rub.</li>
      <li>💨 Let your tattoo breathe for a few minutes, then apply a thin layer of recommended aftercare ointment.</li>
      <li>👕 Wear loose, clean clothing over the area — avoid tight or abrasive fabrics.</li>
      <li>🌞 Avoid direct sunlight, swimming, and soaking your tattoo until it's fully healed (about 2-4 weeks).</li>
      <li>🙅‍♀️ Do not pick, scratch, or peel the scabs or flakes!</li>
      <li>📞 Contact me if you have any questions or concerns during healing!</li>
    </ul>
